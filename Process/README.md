# Process Documentation

## 12.03.19
We've been working on this for a long time, but it's time to take this process live.

## 09.01.20
The last half year has been... interesting. COVID happened. Life happened. But through it all we did tons of work on the Pando project. 
What we did not do was update this documentation. 
The commit from the first day of September includes arduino integration with the rocking chair controller, video and stop-animation tests, shader experiments, and an intro section, tentatively called 'breathing.'
The main structure of the experience has been worked out, and the next stage is to refine all of this into a single, more cohesive, Unity project.
