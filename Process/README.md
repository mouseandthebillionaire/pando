We've been working on this for a long time, but it's time to take this process live.

## Okay, Let's Try This Again - 09.01.20
The last half year has been... interesting. COVID happened. Life happened. But through it all we did tons of work on the Pando project. 
What we did not do was update this documentation. 
The commit from the first day of September includes arduino integration with the rocking chair controller, video and stop-animation tests, shader experiments, and an intro section, tentatively called 'breathing.'
The main structure of the experience has been worked out, and the next stage is to refine all of this into a single, more cohesive, Unity project.

## Stage 1 Complete - 11.10.20
Unity setup is complete: ready for composing and bringing in the art assets

## Music - 1.05.21
Music has been composed and we are starting to separate out the files and import 
them into the Unity project.
