# Pando

An interactive installation that explores the distant past through the story of Pando, an aspen grove that is one of the oldest and largest living organisms on Earth. The final installation will involve two participants who will sit in a modified rocking chair with motion sensors attached. Their movement will affect the sonic and visual aspects of the piece, with participants exploring how synchronous or alternating movement of the chairs as well as speed, pauses, and other gestures advance the narrative.
